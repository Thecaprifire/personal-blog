# Personal Blog

## Description
This project is part of the Web APIs Challenge series. It involves creating a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. The main features include building a content form for users to submit their blog posts, dynamically rendering these posts on a separate page, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle for improved user experience. By working on this project, developers will gain practical experience in JavaScript, explore the power of the Document Object Model (DOM), and set the stage for tackling more advanced web development tasks.

## Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the landing page of the website.
2. Input your username, blog title, and blog content into the provided form.
3. Submit the form to create a new blog post.
4. Navigate to the posts page to view all submitted blog posts.
5. Use the light/dark mode toggle to adjust the appearance of the website according to your preference.
6. Click the "Back" button to return to the landing page and input more blog entries.
